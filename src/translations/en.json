      "welcome2": "<p>This web tool allows you to compare the results from different scenarios, view the effects on the energy system when applying additional assumptions to the model. Data from each figure and the full result dataset can be downloaded for detailed analysis. For further instructions on how to use the web tool and get the most out of the presented results please see, “How to use the results viewer tool”. </p>",
      "welcome3": "<p>The results presented here are highly dependent on assumptions for technology developments and their potential availability, efficiency, and cost to just mention a few factors influencing future pathway developments. What these results tell us is rather which solutions are competing, what synergies exists between low carbon energy technologies, and what factors their development is contingent on.</p>",
