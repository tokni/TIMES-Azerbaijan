      "welcome4": "<p>All NCES scenarios reach carbon neutrality by 2050, but technology choice, fuel consumption, and cost will adapt to the options available to change assumptions on the technological readiness of CCS technologies and limitations on bioenergy availability. </p>",
      "welcome5": "<p>The results presented here are highly dependent on assumptions for technology developments and their potential availability, efficiency, and cost to just mention a few factors influencing future pathway developments. The many combinations of scenarios represented in this tool demonstrates the inherent uncertainty of using scenario modelling to predict the future Nordic energy system. What these results tell us is rather which solutions are competing, what synergies exists between low carbon energy technologies, and what factors their development is contingent on.</p>"
