<!-- **1) Three scenarios show different pathways to carbon neutrality.** 
The NCES project developed three scenarios, all designed to meet the carbon neutrality target by balancing carbon emissions and sinks. While acknowledging the importance of cost-effectiveness, the analytical approach recognised that considering only this criterion is too narrow in scope for policy planning and decision making. As such, the NCES analysis seeks to balance multiple factors that will influence outcomes. Each of the three scenarios reflects a different core element:
- Carbon Neutral Nordic (CNN) seeks the least-cost pathway, taking into account current national plans, strategies, and targets.
- Nordic Powerhouse (NPH) explores the opportunity for the Nordics to play a larger role in the broader European energy transition by providing clean electricity, clean fuels, and carbon storage.
- Climate Neutral Behaviour (CNB) reflects Nordic societies taking additional energy and material efficiency measures in all sectors, ultimately leading to lower demand for both. -->

<!-- **2) Nordic industry and transport are transformed, supported by clean electricity and decarbonised fuels**
Driven by changes in industry and transport, the supply of energy to the Nordic countries is radically transformed in all NCES scenarios; as a result, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions fall by 95%. Decisive action that facilitates clean electricity supply, supports sector coupling, and accelerates energy technology research innovation can deliver this outcome. Wind electricity is central to the transition, enabled by the large Nordic wind resources and supported by flexibility in hydropower reservoirs as well as successful efforts to enhance additional flexibility of the Nordic energy system. Clean electricity is a critical enabler of decarbonisation of industry and transport. -->

<!-- **3) Five solution tracks towards carbon neutrality emerge in the NCES scenarios**
Five solution tracks capturing a majority of available mitigation options emerge from the analysis: direct electrification; power-to-X (PtX-fuels); bioenergy; carbon capture technologies (CCS) including in combination with bioenergy (BECCS); and behavioural change. While direct electrification is at the core of all scenarios, a decarbonisation pathway that balances elements of all five solution tracks to accommodate national contexts will likely be easier to realise than a route completely dominated by any one set of solutions.

**4) Direct electrification is core to all decarbonisation strategies**
Direct electrification of end-use sectors is central to all NCES scenarios. It implies clean electricity directly substituting fuel combustion, for instance in transportation, heating, or industrial processes. In addition to reducing emissions, direct electrification can dramatically improve energy efficiency. With strong electricity grids and large hydropower reservoirs, the Nordic region is well-positioned to leverage the falling costs of renewable electricity generation to accelerate deployment of electric end-use technologies. -->

<!-- **5) Power-to-X: A potential game-changer with profound impact on the Nordic power sector**
Using hydrogen or synthetic methane produced through electric processes (PtX) offers some specific advantages over direct electrification. PtX-fuels can deliver higher energy flow rates, lower-weight storage, and often higher temperatures, making them strong contenders to replace fossil fuels in industry and transport. PtX can also provide flexibility to the energy system, for example by adjusting production to fluctuations in electricity generation and -prices. Finally, transporting PtX fuels can be less costly per kWh than transporting electricity, especially over long distances. Nevertheless, the least-cost scenario (CNN) foresees only a modest Nordic demand for PtX-fuels, below 50 TWh in 2050, mainly because they are significantly more energy intensive than direct electrification as a decarbonisation option.

**6) Bioenergy remains important, but with a shifting role**
Bioenergy already plays an important role in Nordic energy systems, used extensively in district heating or as ‘drop-in’ fuels in transport for example, and continues to do so in all NCES scenarios. Capable of being used directly or converted into other solid or liquid fuels, it shares advantages with PtX in versatility and potential to directly substitute fossil fuels. Towards 2050, in parallel with electrification, the use of biomass should, however, shift to increasingly be utilised in hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy transport, steel and cement.

**7) Carbon capture and storage, and negative emissions are essential**
All NCES scenarios assert that achieving net-zero emissions will be difficult without technologies for CCS, including technologies that would enable negative emissions. In sectors where no viable alternatives for reducing emissions yet exist, CCS or compensation with negative emissions become critical. The Nordic countries are well suited to develop and apply these technologies. -->

<!-- **8) Behavioural change and social acceptance for infrastructure must be considered**
Behavioural change and social acceptance for infrastructure must be considered
Changes in behaviour will directly impact the Nordic energy transition by affecting energy demand and the associated need for infrastructure. But changes need to be significant to have a profound impact on scenario results.

**9) Nordic collaboration is instrumental and would strengthen the Nordics’ Role in the European transition**
The potential of Nordic collaboration becomes more apparent as the generation mix in the Nordic electricity sector is transformed, electricity demand rises, and wind generation takes centre stage. The differences between the individual countries’ energy systems are a strength, while the development of necessary infrastructure emerges as a major coordination challenge in all NCES scenarios.

**10) Robust results provide confidence for critical near-term actions**
While the NCES scenarios identify uncertainties, their inevitable presence should not be used as a pretext for taking no action. Regardless of which decarbonisation pathway is pursued, certain near-term actions and investments clearly deliver substantial benefits. Stronger grids, increased flexibility, wind and solar electricity deployment, electrification of transport, and CCS-technologies are vital to all NCES scenarios. Existing solutions, such as bioenergy and district heating, continue to be important while innovative market developments can unlock the potential of both emerging and existing technologies. -->
