# Scenario Definition
In the following the scenarios represented on the homepage are described. The story line of the scenario and the main assumptions. Also, sensitivity variations are defined.

As TIMES-Azerbaijan is still in a testing phase, the two scenario runs so far should be seen as pure examples and not policy relevant scenarios!

## Base Scenario
Continuing already implemented policies as taxes/subsidies and planned new power capacity. It is assumed that trade of energy carriers and investment in new capacity in all sector will happen on a competing market.

## Carbon Neutral Scenario
Same assumptions as in Base, but with a constraint on the CO2-emissions from the whole energy system of Azerbaijan securing net-zero emissions by 2050.
