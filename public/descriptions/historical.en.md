# <span style="color:#454547">Nordic Energy Statistics Database </span>

The Nordic Energy Statistics Database aims to harmonise energy related data across all five Nordic countries for easy use as a reference for research as well as for the public to explore. Previously there was no common aggregation of Nordic energy statistics and model input. All Nordic countries would need to rely on assumptions about their neighbouring Nordic countriesâ€™ energy systems.
From these data, progress indicators have been developed for:
- Share of RE in electricity consumption
- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) from power and district heating
- Share of bioenergy from gross RE consumption
- Battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles share of total passenger vehicle stock
- District heat generation (PJ) by fuel
- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) from the industrial sector
- Final energy consumption by source (PJ) in industry
- Energy intensity (kWh/m2) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions intensity (kgCO<sub>2</sub>/m2) in the buildings sector 
- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) from road transport

You can review these indicators under the [Historical Indicators](./tab9) tab and view the individual historical statistics under the
[Historical Data tab](./tab10).
