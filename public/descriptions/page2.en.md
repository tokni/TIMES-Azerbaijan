# Country Info

## Geographical scope
The model covers the area of the Republic of Azerbaijan as well as its interconnections with neighbouring countries. It also takes into account the export-oriented energy policy objectives of the country given its endowments in hydrocarbon resources. Azerbaijan is a net hydrocarbon exporter to Georgia, Turkey, and Europe, whereas in the electricity sector it works in parallel with the South Caucasus synchronous area along with Georgia and Russia.

Oil and Natural Gas exports have constituted the main revenue source for the economic development of the country, rendering it vulnerable to external shocks and changes in global oil and gas prices. The Government of Azerbaijan (GoA) has devoted significant efforts to develop its non-oil sector, leading to an increase in the non-oil share of its economy in GDP from 45% in 2010 to 54% in 2019. Considering the volatility of oil prices, there is a pressing need to further diversify the economy of Azerbaijan and move towards a modernized energy system.
