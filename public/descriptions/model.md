 Energy system modelling provides the backbone of the NCES analyses. Two modelling approaches are combined; optimisation analyses of investments in all sectors using the ON-TIMES model, and dispatch and operation analysis focused on the electricity system using the BALMOREL model (Figure 2.7). The sectors covered and their definitions are given in Table 2.6. ON-TIMES covers the five Nordic countries. BALMOREL covers Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Note that Balmorel does not cover Iceland. Additionally, all numbers for 2020 in the report are modelled results and may differ from official statistics.

The analytical toolbox of the NCES includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. Two energy system models, ON-TIMES and BALMOREL, were soft-linked to provide the quantitative backbone of the project. ON-TIMES is a linear optimisation model that covers all Nordic countries and all sectors shown in Table 2.6. BALMOREL is focused on the operation of the power and heat sector, including distribution and trade. BALMOREL covers 18 countries in northern and central Europe. Framework assumptions were informed by literature reviews and extensive stakeholder input.
